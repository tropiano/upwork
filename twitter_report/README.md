# Project Description

I am looking for someone who can help me create automated PDF reports for Twitter clients by extracting data from the Twitter API such as:

- amount of tweets
- retweets received
- likes received
- comments received
- followers gained
- engagement rate

This data needs to be compiled in a PDF so I can send it to clients quickly and easily on a monthly or bi-weekly basis for them to see the results and numbers we are acheiving.

A reporting tool that is similar to what I am talking about is: https://dashthis.com/ , HOWEVER I need this to work without having access to the account which I want to create the report for, since I don't have access to client accounts.

Please only reach out if you can do this WITHOUT access to client accounts. Look forward to hearing your applications.
